summary    : Qt5 Websockets Module
description: |
    WebSocket is a web-based protocol designed to enable two-way communication between a client application and a remote host. It enables the two entities to send data back and forth if the initial handshake succeeds. WebSocket is the solution for applications that struggle to get real-time data feeds with less network latency and minimum data exchange.
    The Qt WebSockets module provides C++ and QML interfaces that enable Qt applications to act as a server that can process WebSocket requests, or a client that can consume data received from the server, or both.
